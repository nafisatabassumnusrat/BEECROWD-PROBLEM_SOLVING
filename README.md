# BEECROWD-PROBLEM_SOLVING
This repository is dedicated to solving problems from Beecrowd using the C programming language. Each solution is organized by the problem title for easy navigation. You'll find the complete source code for every problem I've solved so far. I created this repository to improve my C programming skills and prepare for competitive programming contests like ICPC, where I plan to represent my university.

🚀 Beecrowd C Problem Solving Repository
This repository is a collection of solutions to problems I’ve solved from Beecrowd, using the C programming language.
🧠 Each problem is organized by title for easy access, and you’ll find clean, well-structured source code inside.

💻 I created this repository to improve my logic building and problem-solving skills through hands-on practice.
📚 While solving these problems, I gained experience in:

🔢 Data types, input/output handling

🔁 Loop control and conditionals

🧮 Math-based logic and precision formatting

🔄 Problem analysis and efficient code writing

🧩 Breaking down complex problems into simple logic

🏆 These challenges helped me build a strong foundation in C and prepared me for competitive programming.
🎯 I’m also preparing to participate in ICPC and plan to represent my university proudly in upcoming contests.

📌 Feel free to explore the codes, learn from them, and even suggest improvements! Let’s grow together as problem solvers. 😊
